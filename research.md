### **Conflict, Forced Displacement and Growth: Evidence from Uganda**  

**Abstract:**  
<span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">  
I study the long run economic impact of a large-scale forced displacement policy in Uganda during the civil war. This policy forcibly relocated approximately 90% of the affected districtsâ€™ population into Internal Displacement Camps for up to ten years. The mass displacement led to a lasting increase in population density in the localities hosting camps, which persisted for nearly a decade after people were free to return to their villages of origin. Consequently, the spatial distribution of the population in Northern Uganda was shifted, altering the economic geography and growth in the region. Combining and harmonizing satellite data with novel administrative data, I document that forced displacement led to increases in nighttime light growth, market access, structural transformation towards services and human capital. Yet the effects were not distributed equally: while camps experienced population growth, it is the neighboring now-emptier localities experiencing increases in services employment.  When delving into mechanisms,  I find that the long-term effects of forced displacement are stronger in camps lasted longer, had higher population size, and experienced lower levels of conflict intensity.
