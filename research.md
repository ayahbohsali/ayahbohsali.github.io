    I study the long run economic impact of a large-scale forced displacement policy in Uganda during the civil war. This policy forcibly relocated approximately 90% of the affected districts’ population into Internal Displacement Camps for up to ten years. The mass displacement led to a lasting increase in population density in the localities hosting camps, which persisted for nearly a decade after people were free to return to their villages of origin. Consequently, the spatial	distribution of the population in Northern Uganda was shifted, altering the economic geography and growth in the region. Combining and harmonizing satellite data with novel administrative data, I document that the forced displacement episode led to an occupational shift towards services and an increase in overall education levels. Yet the effects were not distributed equally: while camps experienced population growth, it is the neighboring now-emptier localities experiencing higher increases in services employment. When delving into mechanisms,  I find that the long-term effects of forced displacement are stronger in places where camps lasted longer, and had higher population size. I develop a general equilibrium model that rationalizes these results.

### **Team Size and Performance: Experimental Evidence from India**

    What are the gains of team size for performance? Does new technology diffuse faster in larger groups? To answer these questions and solve the endogenous sorting bias, we run the first randomized controlled trial where 1,582 Indian women were randomly assigned to 206 groups of different size  and encouraged to engage in a production process. 
    We find smaller teams to perform better than larger teams and that technology diffuses non-linearly with team size. 
    By measuring bilateral communication within teams and conducting network analysis across team members, we find that smaller teams are more centralized than medium and larger. Our findings can be explained by smaller teams organizing the production process more efficiently, for example, by assigning tasks to group members and being more likely to reach a consensus on production decisions. To estimate the welfare effects of the intervention, we plan to build a network model with a heterogeneous group size. Size affects coordination costs as well as the impact of new technologies.
